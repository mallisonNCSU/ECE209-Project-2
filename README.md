# ECE209-Project-2
GPS Tracker

Description: This program, given a time, an x coordinate, and a y coordinate per each movement, tracks the movement of a point along 2 roads on a coordinate plane, similar to the way a GPS would. It keeps track of when the point has changed direction, when it turns, what its peak speed is, what the total distance travelled is, and what road the point started on and ended on.
